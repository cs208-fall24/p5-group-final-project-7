## Experience

I would say overall My experence with the project was fun. I thought the ability of creating your own webpage was super cool and fun And I think that was a great main idea. I like the customization in it. It was a good amount of parts to do but I would say each file has its own style so If you just followed the style it was ok. It got a bit tricky when adding the comments page, but I think that just is part of the assessmnet. I think overall i didnt have much issues, bseides time managment because Ive been really busy with all of my other work. In other clases, so time managment was hard but the overall coding was more fun then frustrating, Just that stupid comments part that messed me up for a few hours is what was annoying.


## Known issues or Bugs

When I was messing with the comments thing, I was confused how I was supoosed to structure it, I knew that the index file was to show the buttons and paste them into the website, But i didnt really know how to write the actions for the add comments and delete and stuff, so trying to get those to work was diffacult. But it ended up getting to work evenchally Am im just so glad it did. So im hapoy for that

## Sources used

As all of my other projects my main sources used were the videos and the zybooks, However for this project in praticular I used are old projects for help, Like when it came adding the comments page and stuff I think I used Project 4, one of the projects was really simular when it came to adding a button that someone can change things with on it, So that was a really big help, But i looked through all of the old projects for examples of how to write stuff just so I knew what I was doing, Like for my CSS file I used project 4 and looked at my spiderman themed CSS file and I used a lot of that to remember how to organized a CSS file and change things. It was fun. But Im really glad I took this couse, As always I will end with I hope I get a 100% and I do good on this project, It was a lot of work and I just hope the work payed off. I appricate the help Shane with my questions for the project, Thankyou for being a cool professor!
