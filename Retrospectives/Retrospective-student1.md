## Experience

This project has taught me a lot of things that I think are goig to be super useful for my future in the coding world. One of the biggest things was learning how to work in a team and communicate on those kinds of things. Using github as a main source of version control was nice because I learned hands on what it means to do pull and merge requests and how to work out those conflicts. As for the actual coding I already knew how to do everything based on what we have learned in the class but it was nice to have to work through some issues and learn how to fix them.
