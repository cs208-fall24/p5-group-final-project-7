## Experience

It was great figuring out how to work with others for this project. Unfortunately, Thanksgiving Break did fall right in the middle of the project, so I got a little distracted. Thankfully, I got most of the difficult backend functionality done before break and mainly had to worry about the CSS styling when I got back. I used the Student 1 CSS as a reference so that our sites would look similar, and many times referenced his section to fix bugs. It was great being able to consult other people when I had problems with things. We mainly worked on our own things, but we were able to share code for things like the comment functionality. I did forget to add the comment updating until the very end, so that was a fun surprise. Luckily my group mates were able to remind me.
